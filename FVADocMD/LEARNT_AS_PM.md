# What I learnt as a Product Manager
## Design Thinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first product I was thinking about was FVA Tools.
Then another product came to my mind. So it started to be a Product Line.

- "Wait, wait, you started from thinking of products, right?" you will ask me.
- "Nope, I started from... It was ages ago and whole [history](../README.md#history) is quite big. And I started from coding, because I am developer)".
- "Was it good idea to start from coding?" you will ask me. 
- "Again No. I would start from [Design Thinking](FVADocX/DesignThinking.pptx) if I knew it." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design Thinking is a process of preparation with seven stages to create the product:

- **Empathize-who, goal, do** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - who, goal, do;
- **Empathize-see, say, do, hear** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - see, say, do, hear;
- **Empathize-think and feel** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - think and feel;
- **Define: Problem Statement** Here you need to describe a problem basing on "Empathy Map";
- **Ideate** Here you need to nave a list of raw ideas to explore.
- There are also other stages not meantioned here.
