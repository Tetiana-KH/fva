# What I learnt as a Product Manager
## Design Thinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first product I was thinking about was "FVA Tool Set".
Then another product came to my mind. So it started to be a Product Line.

- "Wait, wait, you started from thinking of products, right?" you will ask me.
- "Nope, I started from... It was ages ago and whole [history](../README.md#history) is quite big. And I started from coding, because I am developer)".
- "Was it good idea to start from coding?" you will ask me. 
- "Again No. I would start from [Design Thinking](../FVADocX/DesignThinking.pptx) if I knew it." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design Thinking is a process of preparation with seven stages to create the product:

- **Empathize-who, goal, do** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - who, goal, do;
- **Empathize-see, say, do, hear** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - see, say, do, hear;
- **Empathize-think and feel** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - think and feel;
- **Define: Problem Statement** Here you need to describe a problem basing on "Empathy Map";
- **Ideate** Here you need to nave a list of raw ideas to explore.
- There are also other stages not meantioned here.

## High level product documentation
Once I came up with product ideas to implement I realized I need to create a set of documentation artifacts to keep high level product knowledge.

### Business Model Canvas
The first one was [Business Model Canvas](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-BusinessModelCanvas.docx). 
I downloaded a template from [here](strategyzer.com) and filled up the following fields
- **Key Partners** to answer the questions: **Who are the key partners? Who are the key suppliers?**
- **Key Activities** to answer the questions: **What the main tasks that the company must do well to deliver its value?**
- **Key Resources** to answer the questions: **What are the most important physical, financial, intellectual or human recourses the company has?**
- **Value Propositions** to answer the questions: **What value do we deliver to the customer? Which customer needs are we satisfying?**
- **Customer Relationships** to answer the questions: **What type of relationship does each of the customer segments expect us to establish and maintain with them?**
- **Channels** to answer the questions: **Through which channels do our customer segments want to be reached? How are we reaching them now?**
- **Customer Segments** to answer the questions: **For whom are we creating value? Who are our most important customers?**
- **Revenue Streams** to answer the questions: **For what value are our customers willing to pay? For what do they currently pay? How are they currently paying? How would they prefer to pay?**
- **Cost Structure** to answer the questions: **Where do the costs come from?**
