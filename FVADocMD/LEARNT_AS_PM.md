# What I learnt as a Product Manager
## Design Thinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first product I was thinking about was "FVA Tool Set".
Then another product came to my mind. So it started to be a Product Line.

- "Wait, wait, you started from thinking of products, right?" you will ask me.
- "Nope, I started from... It was ages ago and whole [history](../README.md#history) is quite big. And I started from coding, because I am developer)".
- "Was it good idea to start from coding?" you will ask me. 
- "Again No. I would start from [Design Thinking](../FVADocX/DesignThinking.pptx) if I knew it." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design Thinking is a process of preparation with seven stages to create the product:

- **Empathize-who, goal, do** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - who, goal, do;
- **Empathize-see, say, do, hear** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - see, say, do, hear;
- **Empathize-think and feel** Here you need to create an artifact "Empathy Map" with formula - think and feel;
- **Define: Problem Statement** Here you need to describe a problem basing on "Empathy Map";
- **Ideate** Here you need to nave a list of raw ideas to explore.
- There are also other stages not meantioned here.

## High level product documentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I came up with product ideas to implement I realized I need to create a set of documentation artifacts to keep high level product knowledge.

### Value Propositions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one was [Value Proposition](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-ValueProposition.docx)
It has following:
- **Mapper** for Products and Services to Customer Jobs;
- **Mapper** for Gain creators to Gains;
- **Mapper** for Pain relievers to Pains;
- **One Pager** with Value Proposition. 

### Business Model Canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next one was [Business Model Canvas](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-BusinessModelCanvas.docx). 
I downloaded a template from [here](strategyzer.com) and filled up the following fields
- **Key Partners** to answer the questions: **Who are the key partners? Who are the key suppliers?**
- **Key Activities** to answer the questions: **What the main tasks that the company must do well to deliver its value?**
- **Key Resources** to answer the questions: **What are the most important physical, financial, intellectual or human recourses the company has?**
- **Value Propositions** to answer the questions: **What value do we deliver to the customer? Which customer needs are we satisfying?**
- **Customer Relationships** to answer the questions: **What type of relationship does each of the customer segments expect us to establish and maintain with them?**
- **Channels** to answer the questions: **Through which channels do our customer segments want to be reached? How are we reaching them now?**
- **Customer Segments** to answer the questions: **For whom are we creating value? Who are our most important customers?**
- **Revenue Streams** to answer the questions: **For what value are our customers willing to pay? For what do they currently pay? How are they currently paying? How would they prefer to pay?**
- **Cost Structure** to answer the questions: **Where do the costs come from?**

### Product Vision Board
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third one was [Product Vision Board](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-ProductVisionBoard.pdf).
I downloaded a template from [here](https://www.romanpichler.com/) and filled up the following fields
- **VISION** to answer the questions: **What is your purpose for creating the product? Which positive change should it bring about?**
- **TARGET GROUP** to answer the questions: **Which market or market segment does the product address? Who are the target customers and users?**
- **NEEDS** to answer the questions: **What problem does the product solve? Which benefit does it provide?**
- **PRODUCT** to answer the questions: **What product is it? What makes it stand out? Is it feasible to develop the product?**
- **BUSINESS GOALS** to answer the questions: **How is the product going to benefit the company? What are the business goals?**

## Product from user prospective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once high level product documentation was ready I wanted to go deaper with more detail from user point of view.

### Persona 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first artifact I craeted was [Persona](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-Persona.pdf)
I downloaded a template from [here](https://www.romanpichler.com/) and filled up the following fields.
- **PICTURE & NAME** to answer the questions: **What does the persona look like? What is its name?.** I choosen a realistic and believable picture and name.
- **DETAILS** to answer the questions: **What are the persona’s relevant characteristics and behaviours?** I filled instance, demographics, such as age, gender, occupation, and income; psychographics, including lifestyle, social class, and personality; and behavioural attributes like usage patterns, attitudes, and brand loyalty.
- **GOAL** to answer the questions: **What problem does the persona want to solve or which benefit does the character seek? Why would the persona want to use or buy the product?**

### User Journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I tried to restore user way to achive the goals. 
And I came up with [User Journey](../FVADocX/FVAToolSet-UserJourney.pptx)

### Stakeholders

 

- [Stakeholders](FVADocX/FVAToolSet-Stakeholders.pptx)

## Capabilities
- **Organizing the multimedia:** Organizing the [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) to be more searchable
- **Integration:** The system is integrated with online/offline [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md):
[digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/> as Offline [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) and 
[Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/SynologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" /> as Online [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) are now supported. 
- **Multimedia metadata gaps identification:** It identifies the gaps and tries to fill it up.
- **Text search:** It is possible to search by events, photo author, places, people using text search 
- **Configuration:** The system flow depends on configuration.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The **main functions** (basing on user search needs) of FVA Software are: 
* To **automate the import** (with decreasing the probability of human factor influence on the process of importing new photos into the existing photo album);
* To **make photo albums more searchable** (that is driven by [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md)) by enriching the metadata (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.

Despite many steps are automated, still human involvement is required.
 
The solution is oriented on **end users** only.
Only open source code/tools are used, as a product is **open source**.
