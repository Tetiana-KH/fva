# What I learnt as a Delivery Manager
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly I did not learn a lot as a Delivery Manager. But...

## Project Status tracking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite important activity of Delivery Manager to track project status.

### GitHub projects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **GitHub Projects** is tool to track the project status online integrated into your GitHub profile.
It is quite simple to use and it does not have a lot of functions.

### ProjectLibre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still more compex solution was required. 
And I chose [ProjectLibre](https://www.projectlibre.com/product/1-alternative-microsoft-project-open-source)
ProjectLibre desktop is a free and open-source project management software system intended ultimately as a standalone replacement for Microsoft Project.
Despite it is a free and small application it gave me everything I needed
