## Multimedia Organizers functions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A program that helps organizing photos is known as a **photo organizer**.
There are a variety of **photo organizer** software programs available on the market, and each one provides various features and tools to assist in organizing photos.
Thus, let’s consider main functions multimedia organizers perform:

* they provide the possibility to search through a photo set by organizing photos based on their date, location, categories, etc.;
* they offer an option of creating a folder structure and place the files in it;
* they automate the import of new photos into **IR Multimedia Systems**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, they make photo albums more searchable (that is driven by **IR Multimedia Systems**) by enriching the **metadata** (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, they are chosen as a subject for the overview and comparison.
A list of **Photo Organizers** for professional photographers is created [[8]](./REFERENCES.md), and those organizers can also be used by an ordinary user with a big photo album.
Pertinent online courses [[28]](./REFERENCES.md) are available to instruct users on how to arrange the photos.
More detailed comparison of photo organizers is provided by Wikipedia and is available here [[9]](./REFERENCES.md).

## Multimedia Organizer requirements

* a user will be working with a large number of items, so automated approach is recommended;
* a toolset that is available for a typical user and not for enterprises shall be used;
* they shall provide integration with such **Multimedia IR Systems** as **digiKam** and **Synology Moments**;
* they shall be able to identify inconsistent or nonexistent photo metadata;
* they shall be able to suggest ways to solve inconsistency and absence.

## Multimedia Organizer approaches to create folder structure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal is to prevent duplicate photos from being stored in the same folder [[8]](./REFERENCES.md).
In order to construct subfolders based on the number of photographers or cameras, the folder name may be something like Date Shoot-Type Event Name; 
it could also contain a location or any other information the user desires.
