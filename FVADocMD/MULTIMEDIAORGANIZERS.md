## There are photo organizers that provide the functions to:
* automate the import the new photos into IR Multimedia Systems. 
* make photo album more searchable (that is driven by IR Multimedia Systems) by enriching the metadata (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.  
  Therefore, they are chosen as a subject for the overview and comparison. 
This [[8]](./REFERENCES.md) provides the list of Photo Organizer for professional photographer and those organizers can be used by a usual user with a big photo album. 
There are even relevant online courses[[28]](./REFERENCES.md) available to guide the user how to organize the photos.
The more detailed comparison of photo organizers is provided by Wikipedia and available here [[9]](./REFERENCES.md).

## Multimedia Organizers overview
* They currently perform the search in photo set by organizing the photos based on their date, location, categories, etc.;
* They suggest to create a folder structure and put the files on it;
* The folder name can be something like Date_Shoot-Type_Event Name;
* It can also include a location or any other information the user wants;
* In such a way the user can create subfolders based on the number of photographers or cameras;
* The idea is to avoid photos having the same file name in the folder [[8]](./REFERENCES.md).

## Requirements
* They shall be able to identify of inconsistent or not existing photo metadata;
* They shall be able to suggest the ways to solve the inconsistency and absence;
* The most automated approach possible should be used because a user is going to work with a large number of items;
* A toolset available for a usual user and not for the enterprises shall be used as well.
* They shall provide integration with such Multimedia IR Systems like digiKam and Synology Moments.
