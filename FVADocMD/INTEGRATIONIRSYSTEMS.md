As it was mentioned before in the business requirements(aka features), the integration with offline Multimedia IR system is implemented through the integration with [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/about/) and integration with online Multimedia IR system is implemented through the integration with [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos).
Because the Multimedia IR system performs the search by certain criteria basing on multimedia [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata), the FVA Software shall be working with the same multimedia [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) to be integrated with Multimedia IR system.
