&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's make a brief overview of the **Multimedia IR systems**.
**Information retrieval (IR)** is the process of finding information system resources from a collection of those resources that are pertinent to an information demand, according to Wikipedia [[15]](./REFERENCES.md). 
Furthermore, **Multimedia information retrieval** (MMIR or MIR) is a research area of computer science that aims to extract semantic information from **multimedia data** sources, according to Wikipedia as well [[16]](./REFERENCES.md). 
Information is gathered from a variety of sources, including directly perceivable media like audio, image, and video, indirectly perceivable sources like text, semantic descriptions, and biosignals, as well as not perceivable sources such as bioinformation, stock prices, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A computer system for browsing, searching, and retrieving images from a sizable database of digital images is called an **Image Retrieval system**. 
In order to execute retrieval over the words annotated to the photos, the majority of conventional and traditional techniques of image retrieval employ a certain method of adding information to the images, such as captioning, keywords, titles or descriptions [[17]](./REFERENCES.md).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, when they discuss private **Multimedia IR** that searches through images and photos, they refer to the search based on the [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata), tags and content of the images and photos [[6]](./REFERENCES.md). 
The indexing and storage functionality for the **multimedia** information is also implemented by the **Multimedia IR** systems in response to market demand.
However, those systems might also have features like the ability to extract descriptions from **multimedia data**.
It goes without saying that if an average family does not have the **Multimedia IR** system to search for one item in thirty thousand photos, it would almost be impossible to find that one item by means of manual search. 
For this reason, the prospects offered by **Multimedia IR systems** would be of great interest to regular people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the end user's point of view, when they are accessing the photo album, the main need is the ability to search through the photo album easily and quickly.
In terms of searching ability, it shall also provide the cataloging abilities and browsing the search results. Obviously, the search systems shall provide the full and correct search results.

## User's needs in Multimedia IR Systems
* the Multimedia IR system shall provide (or be integrated with other tools) an ability to keep the different types of multimedia data;
* it should be possible to represent any kind of multimedia information (photo, video, and audio) to user via UI;
* it should provide a simple way to edit the multimedia data;
* it should be possible to search through the content quickly and easily;
* it should allow filtering of information by several sets of criteria;
* relevance feedback shall be implemented; 
* it should include indexing and cataloging functions;
* it should be possible to find information by example of image;
* it should include a function of browsing through the search results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, not ordinary people only, but also the businesses might find Multimedia IR systems useful due to their professional needs. 
For example, there might be different professions who access the photos or images often in their everyday work activity, such as:

## Professional's needs in Multimedia IR systems
* photographers that provide their services to companies;
* journalists who work with camera to create multimedia news content;
* people of different professions who need access to images, like medical professionals searching for medical images or architects requiring the image examples to create the buildings;
* car engineers who need photographs and sound of car engines;
* video content engineers, when looking for special video segments and movies by their titles.
