# Quality attributes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section lists quality attributes for target architecture.
For each quality attribute it provides name, description, motivation (rationale for selecting), measurable metrics and priorities from business and architecture points of view.
The metrics show whether a particular quality attribute is achieved or not.
The components where metric is measured is noted as well.

# Conceptual Integrity
The software shall be decomposed into well-structured modules according to functional decomposition. 

## Motivation for selecting
TBD

## Metrics
The code review process shall be established to make sure the modules are structured according to functional decomposition

## Business value - Low
## Architecture viewpoint - Middle

# Maintainability
The system shall be able to undergo changes with a high level of easiness.

## Motivation for selecting
The following changes might happen frequently:
-changes applied to the [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) like adding new screen;
-adding new multimedia formats to support;
-new [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) search criteria to handle.
-new offline or online IR Multimedia Systems can be easily integrated

## Metrics
The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used.

## Business value - Middle
## Architecture viewpoint - High
                                              
# Reusability
The system components shall be usable in other functionality or other flows.

## Motivation for selecting
It is applied for deduplication of implementation and to reduce the implementation time spent).

## Metrics
A common library is going to be created to keep the following functions used by several components:
-To work with configuration;
-Logging functions;
-Common [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) functions;

## Business value - Middle
## Architecture viewpoint - High

# Availability
TBD

## Motivation for selecting

## Business value - TBD
## Architecture viewpoint - TBD

# Interoperability
The proposed solution shall have the ability to be integrated with online and offline Multimedia IR systems in the common way.

## Motivation for selecting
The system shall be able to be integrated to any IR Multimedia Systems with a high level of easiness.

## Metrics
The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used.
