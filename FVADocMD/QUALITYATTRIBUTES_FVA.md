# Quality attributes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section lists quality attributes for target architecture.
For each quality attribute it provides name, description, motivation (rationale for selecting), measurable metrics and priorities from business and architecture points of view.
The metrics show whether a particular quality attribute is achieved or not.
The components where metric is measured is noted as well.

# Conceptual Integrity
## Description
The software shall be decomposed into well-structured modules according to functional decomposition. 

## Motivation for selecting
TBD

## Metrics
The code review process shall be established to make sure the modules are structured according to functional decomposition

## Business value
Low

Middle

# Maintainability
## Description
The system shall be able to undergo changes with a high level of easiness.

## Motivation for selecting
The following changes might happen frequently:
-changes applied to the [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) like adding new screen;
-adding new multimedia formats to support;
-new [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) search criteria to handle.
-new offline or online IR Multimedia Systems can be easily integrated

## Metrics
The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used.
