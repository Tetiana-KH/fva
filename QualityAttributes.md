# Quality Attributes
For each quality attribute it provides name, description, motivation (rationale for selecting), measurable metrics and priorities from business and architecture points of view.
The metrics show whether a particular quality attribute is achieved or not.
The components where metric is measured is noted as well.

|Conceptual Integrity|The software shall be decomposed into well-structured modules according to functional decomposition|TBD                     |The code review process shall be established to make sure the modules are structured according to functional decomposition|Low           |Middle                |
|Maintainability     |The system shall be able to undergo changes with a high level of easiness|The following changes might happen frequently: - changes applied to the [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) like adding new screen; - adding new multimedia formats to support; - new [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) search criteria to handle. - new offline or online IR Multimedia Systems can be easily integrated|The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used|Middle|High|
|Reusability         |The system components shall be usable in other functionality or other flows|It is applied for deduplication of implementation and to reduce the implementation time spent)|A common library is going to be created to keep the following functions used by several components: - To work with configuration; - Logging functions; - Common [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) functions;|Middle|High|
|Availability        |TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|
|Interoperability    |The proposed solution shall have the ability to be integrated with online and offline Multimedia IR systems in the common way|The system shall be able to be integrated to any IR Multimedia Systems with a high level of easiness|The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used|High|High|
|Manageability       |The system shall be monitorable via [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) and logging.The system shall support debugging as well|It is applied to easily support the systems operations in the fields|The code review process shall be established to make sure the  Each component shall use [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) and logging component: - to save any important events - to disk via logging; - to show the progress of processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to show any important events - to user in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to provide the user with an ability to cancel the processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface)|Middle|High|
|Performance         |The same as for the whole system, the [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) shall respond in less than 1 second. As there might be time-consuming jobs, it shall show the current progress for such operations to provide the user with a status|It is applied to support great UX|The regular performance test shall be performed to check it|High|Low|
|Reliability         |If the system is going to fail during an operation, it shall report the operation status to user with error description and roll back all applied changes for this operation|TBD|TBD|High|High|
|Scalability         |TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|
|Security            |Each multimedia file shall have “read only” attribute set up after processing on Windows|It is applied not to allow it easily change multimedia after processing|Functional test shall be created to check if all multimedia files after processing are marked with “read only” flag|Low|Low|
|Portability         |The software shall support all wide known desktop/laptop [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) - Windows, MacOS, Linux Ubuntu with the latest update.No support of the web or mobile platform required|Those platforms are selected to cover about 100% of desktop user|TBD|High|Middle|
|Supportability      |During abnormal function, the software shall provide the information to find and to solve the issues via prompting user in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) and saving detailed information into the log file. Also it has: - to show the progress of processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to show any important events to user in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to provide the user with an ability to cancel the processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface). The user shall be able to change a log level as configurable parameter|It is applied to easily support the systems operations in the fields and for monitoring. TBD - Add a description for Administration tools and specific deployment aspects|TBD|High|Middle|
|Testability         |TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|TBD|
