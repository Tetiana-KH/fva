# Quality Attributes
For each quality attribute it provides name, description, motivation (rationale for selecting), measurable metrics and priorities from business and architecture points of view.
The metrics show whether a particular quality attribute is achieved or not.
The components where metric is measured is noted as well.

|Conceptual Integrity|The software shall be decomposed into well-structured modules according to functional decomposition|TBD                     |The code review process shall be established to make sure the modules are structured according to functional decomposition|Low           |Middle                |
|Maintainability     |The system shall be able to undergo changes with a high level of easiness|The following changes might happen frequently: - changes applied to the [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) like adding new screen; - adding new multimedia formats to support; - new [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) search criteria to handle. - new offline or online IR Multimedia Systems can be easily integrated|The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used|Middle|High|
|Reusability         |The system components shall be usable in other functionality or other flows|It is applied for deduplication of implementation and to reduce the implementation time spent)|A common library is going to be created to keep the following functions used by several components: - To work with configuration; - Logging functions; - Common [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) functions;|Middle|High|

|Interoperability    |The proposed solution shall have the ability to be integrated with online and offline Multimedia IR systems in the common way|The system shall be able to be integrated to any IR Multimedia Systems with a high level of easiness|The code review process shall be defined to make sure the [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern are going to be used|High|High|
|Manageability       |The system shall be monitorable via [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) and logging.The system shall support debugging as well|It is applied to easily support the systems operations in the fields|The code review process shall be established to make sure the  Each component shall use [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) and logging component: - to save any important events - to disk via logging; - to show the progress of processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to show any important events - to user in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface); - to provide the user with an ability to cancel the processing in [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface)|Middle|High|
