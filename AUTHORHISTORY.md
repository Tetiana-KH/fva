## Here is my history on why I created this product
When I was a child I used to observe the family photo album to take a look at my relations who I have not seen in real life.
At that time we had film cameras only and so the amount of photos was not so big.
Time changed and right now let say almost everyone owns a camera or a smartphone with camera or even both.
Because of that the size of my photo album increased significally. But I don't think it is for me only.

The current IR Multimedia systems don't provide a flexible and automated functionality to import the multimedia data into IR Multimedia systems basing on user search needs. Despite there are a lot of steps that can be automated, still a human involvement is required.
	 So, automation for importing the new photo set into photo album might be highly required feature for IR Multimedia systems as it can identify and address some issues that shall be fixed before user starts searching the data using IR Multimedia system. It should not implement any search function like search by emotions but  it shall only support adding/fixing metadata at the import photo stage.
	The set of tools in form of desktop applications shall be developed. The main functions of that tool set are 
to automate the import (with decreasing the probability of human factor influence on the process of importing new photos into the existing photo album) 
to make photo album more searchable (that is driven by IR Multimedia Systems) by enriching the metadata (and improving its consistency) with minimal human involvement.
	The solution shall be oriented on end users only.
	Mainly only opensource tools shall be used as a product is going to be opensource.
The IR Multimedia Systems that are present on the market and available for end user were analyzed to find the issues related to their usage.
The available products on the market that help the end user to address those issues were checked. 
Those products were compared with the solution proposed.
The approaches and the tools that can help in project implementation were checked.
Two IR Multimedia Systems were  verified if can easily be integrated with the proposed solution.
