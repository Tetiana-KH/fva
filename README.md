## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FVA Software is a convergent tool set in form of desktop applications to automate the process of importing the [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) (photo/audio/video)
into the [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) like [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/>, Google Photo, Apple Photo, [Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/SynologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" />, etc. to make the multimedia more searchable and to improve family photos.

## History
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a child, I used to observe the family photo album to look at my relatives who I have not seen in real life.
At that time, we had film cameras only and so the amount of photos was not so big.
Time changed and right now let's say almost everyone owns a camera or a smartphone with a camera or even both.
Because of that, the size of my photo album increased significantly. However, I do not think it is for me only.
<img src="./FVADocMD/Images/Anaveragefamilyphotoalbum.gif" alt="Anaveragefamilyphotoalbum.gif" />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Me and my friend decided to recall an event we both attended. We took my photo album and tried to search there. 
That time my album kept more than 30 thousand items inside. That search process looked like
<img src="./FVADocMD/Images/Asearchinphotoalbumwith30thousandphotos.gif" alt="Asearchinphotoalbumwith30thousandphotos.gif" />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we found nothing that time. Therefore, I started looking for a solution to search in [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) in an automatic way. 
What I found as a solution were the [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md). 
</br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I selected to use [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/) <img src="./FVADocMD/Images/digiKam.png" alt="digiKam.png" width="20" height="20"/> as Offline [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) and [Synology Moments](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/moments) <img src="FVADocMD/Images/SynologyMoments.png" alt="SynologyMoments.png" height="20" /> as Online [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md).
Please notice they were selected based on author criteria only and there is no aim to advertise anyone.
</br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I started using it...  What I found just immediately there, that the current [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md) do not provide a flexible and automated functionality to import the [Multimedia Data](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIADATA.md) into [Multimedia IR systems](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAIRSYSTEMS.md).
However, it was not the last issue.
</br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I understood that I aslo need [Multimedia Organizer](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAORGANIZERS.md).
Unfortunately, I did not find a [Multimedia Organizer](./FVADocMD/MULTIMEDIAORGANIZERS.md) that fully suited my needs (fixing problem metadata, working with **digiKam** and **Synology** etc.)
That is why I started creating my [own product](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva) to cover my needs.
</br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly I did not expect that it would be so hard and meanwhile so interesting.

## Contributing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the development is in a hot stage and anyone is always welcome to contribute.
You can fill up this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EI3oOumRnHxDjEYgV6PFB-AMfV5plLtuV2r5S8BYn_g/edit) to understand your needs in Multimedia search and organizing.
You can also leave an issue here [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/issues) to request a feature or report a bug.
[Here](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/discussions) you can start a discussion.
</br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can try themself in different roles to learn something new: 
- [As a product manager](./FVADocMD/LEARNT_AS_PM.md);
- [As a delivery manager](./FVADocMD/LEARNT_AS_DM.md);
- [As an application architect](./FVADocMD/LEARNT_AS_SA.md); 
- [As a software developer](./FVADocMD/LEARNT_AS_DEV.md).
- [As a subject matter expert](./FVADocMD/LEARNT_AS_SME.md). 
- [As a software tester you can download the installation packages](https://github.com/dimanikulin/fva/releases) that are published for Linux (x86-64), Mac and Windows (latest versions) to try it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are many items to help the author in.
